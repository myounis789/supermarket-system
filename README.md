## Description

The Supermarket Checkout System is a command-line application that allows users to manage a shopping cart and calculate the total price of items in the cart. It utilises special pricing to calculate final shopping about based on purchase quantities and applies the relevant discount (if any). It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles and is a good starting point for learning Java.

## Installation

To install and run the Supermarket Checkout System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myounis789/supermarket-system.git
   cd supermarket-system

2. **Compile the code:**

 If you have Java installed, compile the code with:

   `javac *.java*`

3. **Run the program:** 

After compiling the code, you can run the program by executing:

`java Main`

Ensure you are in the 'Supermarket System' directory. This will run the Main class and display the checkout system in action.

NOTE: Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

## How to Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Choose items from the list (Apple, Banana, Carrot, Date).
3. Enter the quantity for each item.
4. Continue shopping or finalize your purchase to see the total price.
